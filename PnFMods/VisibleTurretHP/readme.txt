How to install:

1) Place this folder "VisibleTurretHP" under a "PnFMods" folder in WoWS game directory.
   The path will be something like "C:\Games\World_of_Warships\bin\(version_number)\res_mods\PnFMods\VisibleTurretHP"

2) If there is no file named "PnFModsLoader.py" in "res_mods" folder, create an empty textfile and rename.
   The file may already exist when you have installed Aslain or Official ModPack.
